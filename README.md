Adding Redis for caching
In this section, we will now discuss Redis, which can improve the performance of our REST applications. Redis is an open source, in-memory, key-value data store that allows data to reside in memory to enable low latency and faster data access. Compared to traditional databases, Redis doesn’t require disk access, having all data cached in the memory, which gives a quicker response.

It is now widely used, especially for large applications that receive millions of requests. It is compatible with different data structures such as strings, lists, sets, hashes, bitmaps, and geospatial and is compatible with Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub), used for real-time chat applications
